# SEALS Shell Scripts
A small collection of helpful scripts to evaluate SEALS packages.
The <a href="https://github.com/DanFaria/OAEI_SealsClient">SEALS Client</a> is required.
Note that the client requires Java 8.
The scripts were only tested on MacOS but may also run on Linux.

In order to develop matchers, build SEALS packages, and to evaluate matchers in depth, I can recommend the <a href="https://github.com/dwslab/melt/">Matching and EvaLuation Toolkit (MELT)</a>.
